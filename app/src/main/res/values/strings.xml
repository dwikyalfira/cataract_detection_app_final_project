    <string name="eye_health_description">Your eyes are one of your most important senses. Maintaining good eye health is crucial for your overall well-being and quality of life. Regular eye check-ups and early detection of eye conditions can help preserve your vision.</string>
    <string name="what_are_cataracts">What are Cataracts?</string>
    <string name="cataracts_description">Cataracts are a clouding of the eye\'s natural lens, which lies behind the iris and pupil. They are the most common cause of vision loss in people over age 40 and are the principal cause of blindness worldwide.</string>
    <string name="cataract_symptoms">Common symptoms include:\n• Blurry or cloudy vision\n• Difficulty seeing at night\n• Sensitivity to light and glare\n• Seeing halos around lights\n• Frequent changes in eyeglass prescription</string>
    <string name="prevention_tips">Prevention Tips</string>
    <string name="prevention_content">While cataracts are largely age-related, you can take steps to protect your eyes:\n\n• Wear sunglasses with UV protection\n• Quit smoking\n• Eat a healthy diet rich in antioxidants\n• Manage diabetes and other health conditions\n• Get regular eye examinations\n• Limit alcohol consumption</string>
    <string name="treatment_options">Treatment Options</string>
    <string name="treatment_content">Cataract surgery is one of the most common and successful procedures performed today. The surgery involves removing the clouded lens and replacing it with a clear artificial lens.\n\nEarly detection through regular eye exams is key to successful treatment and maintaining good vision.</string>

    <string name="cnn_subtitle">features from input images</string>
    <string name="cnn_overview">CNN Overview</string>
    <string name="cnn_overview_content">A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a deep learning algorithm that can take in an input image, assign importance (learnable weights and biases) to various aspects/objects in the image, and be able to differentiate one from the other.</string>
    <string name="cnn_how_it_works">How CNN Works</string>
    <string name="cnn_how_it_works_content">CNNs use a mathematical operation called convolution in place of general matrix multiplication in at least one of their layers. They are particularly effective for image recognition tasks because they can automatically learn spatial hierarchies of features from input images.</string>
    <string name="cnn_layers">CNN Layers</string>
    <string name="cnn_layers_content">• Convolutional Layer: Detects features like edges, lines, and curves\n• Pooling Layer: Reduces spatial dimensions and computational complexity\n• Fully Connected Layer: Makes final predictions based on learned features</string>
    <string name="cnn_in_cataract_detection">CNN in Cataract Detection</string>
    <string name="cnn_in_cataract_detection_content">Our CNN model has been trained on thousands of eye images to identify patterns associated with cataracts. It can detect subtle changes in the eye lens that may indicate the presence of cataracts, providing an early warning system for users.</string>
    <string name="cnn_advantages">Advantages of CNN</string>
    <string name="cnn_advantages_content">• High accuracy in image classification\n• Automatic feature extraction\n• Robust to variations in lighting and angle\n• Fast processing once trained\n• Can detect patterns invisible to human eye</string>
    <string name="cnn_limitations">Important Limitations</string>
    <string name="cnn_limitations_content">While CNN technology is powerful, it has limitations:\n\n• Requires large amounts of training data\n• May not work well with poor quality images\n• Cannot replace professional medical diagnosis\n• Results should be verified by healthcare professionals</string>

    <string name="info_what_is_title">What is Cataract?</string>
    <string name="info_what_is_content">A cataract is a clouding of the normally clear lens of the eye. For people who have cataracts, seeing through cloudy lenses is a bit like looking through a frosty or fogged-up window. Clouded vision caused by cataracts can make it more difficult to read, drive a car (especially at night) or see the expression on a friend\'s face.</string>
    <string name="info_symptoms_title">Common Symptoms</string>
    <string name="info_symptoms_content">• Clouded, blurred or dim vision\n• Increasing difficulty with vision at night\n• Sensitivity to light and glare\n• Need for brighter light for reading and other activities\n• Seeing \'halos\' around lights\n• Frequent changes in eyeglass or contact lens prescription\n• Fading or yellowing of colors\n• Double vision in a single eye</string>
    <string name="info_prevention_title">Prevention</string>
    <string name="info_prevention_content">• Have regular eye examinations\n• Quit smoking\n• Take care of other health problems\n• Choose a healthy diet that includes plenty of fruits and vegetables\n• Wear sunglasses that block ultraviolet B (UVB) rays\n• Reduce alcohol use\n• Maintain a healthy weight</string>
    <string name="info_risk_factors_title">Risk Factors</string>
    <string name="info_risk_factors_content">• Increasing age\n• Diabetes\n• Excessive exposure to sunlight\n• Smoking\n• Obesity\n• High blood pressure\n• Previous eye injury or inflammation\n• Previous eye surgery\n• Prolonged use of corticosteroid medications\n• Drinking excessive amounts of alcohol</string>
    <string name="info_treatment_title">Treatment</string>
    <string name="info_treatment_content">When your prescription glasses can\'t clear your vision, the only effective treatment for cataracts is surgery. Cataract surgery involves removing the clouded lens and replacing it with a clear artificial lens. The artificial lens, called an intraocular lens, is positioned in the same place as your natural lens. It remains a permanent part of your eye.</string>
